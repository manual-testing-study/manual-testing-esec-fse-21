# Survey Questions & Results

In [`survey-answers_anonymized.xlsx`](https://github.com/manual-testing-study/manual-testing-esec-fse-21/blob/main/survey/survey-answers_anonymized.xlsx) you can view all survey questions and respective answers from the survey participants (anonymized).
Start in the worksheet `Label Question-Mapping` and go to the individual questions' worksheets to see the answers (e.g., for question with label `A101` navigate to worksheet `A101`).

**Note:** We deliberately kept the given answers in their original language, which can be either English or German.
